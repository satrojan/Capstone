We want to say, you have done a tremendous job inside of the league after being selected in the 2nd Round of the 1983 NBA Draft, and we can fairly go to say, you are a steal of a gem inside of that draft, and we want to give you the opportunity to show off your talents inside of the State of Texas.

Rodney McCray of course at Small Forward, Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon at the Big Man Spots. Our team is guaranteed to win at least one championship and that is at least something you couldn't have in Atlanta.
